#  Introduction

This is my personal diary for learning and documenting all things web3.
## Motivation

I wanted to implement my version of swyx's #LearninginPublic, and I found that merely posting about what I learned everyday as a blog post lacked a certain 'structure' that I could easily track in my mind to get a sense of the progress I'm making in the never-ending quest to get a grasp of the web3 ecosystem.

So I turned to docusaurus to create that structure for me.

```
const a = 5;
```

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
